### Zero Trust Pillars & Maturity Model:

- the pillars (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications and Workloads, Data</mark>) <u>and cross-cutting capabilities</u> (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visibility, automation, governance</mark>) in the CISA ZTMM

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The CISA ZTMM</mark> <u>helps organizations enhance their ZT strategies</u> as it outlines maturity stages Traditional, Initial, Advanced, and Optimal– across the ZT pillars and capabilities.

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This maturity model has 4 stages:</mark> 
	1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Traditional</mark>**: security controls are typically based on <u>firewalls and static policies. </u>
	2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Initial</mark>**: centralized <u>identity management</u> and <u>device security</u> is introduced. <u>Networks</u> start to be <u>segmented</u>. 
	3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Advanced</mark>**: <u>continuous and dynamic controls</u> are implemented. 
	4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Optimal</mark>**: Functions<u> like identity management and network segregation are fully automated and adaptive.</u>
#### **AI's Role in Cloud Security**

AI functions both as a security tool and a potential attack vector in cloud environments. It enhances security by detecting threats and automating defenses but also poses risks by enabling sophisticated cyber attacks.

#### **Characteristics of AI Workloads**

AI workloads fall into two categories:

- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Training</mark>** – Requires massive data and computing power to create models.
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inference</mark>** – Runs trained models to analyze or generate data.

Neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), are widely used in AI applications.

#### **AI and Cloud Security**

AI workloads are substantial and require secure data handling. AI is increasingly integrated into security solutions for better threat detection while also being exploited for attacks.

#### **AI Deployment Models in Cloud Security**

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI as a Service (SaaS)</mark>** – Fully managed AI solutions (e.g., Claude). Security measures include controlling data access and tracking usage.
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI as a Platform (PaaS)</mark>** – Cloud providers offer infrastructure for AI model hosting (e.g., AWS Bedrock). Security involves securing training data, access control, and defending against adversarial attacks.
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)</mark>** – Organizations develop or deploy AI models using cloud resources. Requires in-house expertise and strong security controls.
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI-Enhanced Security Tools</mark>** – AI is embedded into security solutions for smarter threat detection, policy enforcement, and access control.

As AI continues to evolve, its impact on cloud security will grow, necessitating robust defenses against AI-driven threats.
